jsExpressEdit 1.1 is a javascript/jquery based HTML structure modifier/editor with extended search then move, wrap, create, delete,  search/replace of found element(s) and sorting capabilities.  This editor can be used as a stand-alone html editor (html included in this repository) but also easily integrated into CMS. jsExpressEdit is also demonstrated in action complementing tinymce to quickly transform HTML structure and styling to current needs.  View these demonstration videos of jsexpressedit.js modifying and sorting figures,images,captions, and responsive embedded videos for a thaifood restaurant demo on www.jsexpressedit.com. Here one can also link to videos detailing the full creation of the thaifood restaurant on www.expressedit.org/create_new_page.php from a completely empty page and also includes the jsexpressedit videos taking part.
 
Note: Test using jQuery v2.2.4
The Primary drag and drop sorting method demonstrated in one of the jsexpressedit videos requires the open source tool-man repository by: Tim Taylor. 
Note:  the full feature video demo of jsexpressedit utilizes the expressedit CMS system and TinyMce 4.96 version.
